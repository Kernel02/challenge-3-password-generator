## Password Generator

A generator that produces a random password based on the parameters the user gives it. The user will select the length of the password, as well as the character types they want their password to include. The character types that can choose from are as follows: numeric, special, lowercase and uppercase letters. The structure and style of the page was there prior to me working on it. I used JavaScript to develop a single function to generate a random password given certain parameters. I much enjoyed figuring out how to take the results from the prompt/confirms and translate them to result arrays of charcters, which will be randomly selected.
